## Worker

Workers are used in the building of all objects in the game and act as planet defence against Invasion. Your planet will naturally grow population at steady rate until your housing is filled.

## Soldier

An Army Barracks is required to begin Training Soldiers.

Soldiers are used to Invade hostile planets during the game. Soldiers are also the most useful type in protecting your own planets from Invasion.<br/>

You will need 1 soldier for every 10 hostile workers you want to kill, and 3 soldiers for every 2 defending enemy soldiers
